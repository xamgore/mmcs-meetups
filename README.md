This website is designed to illuminate the events, held at the faculty of mathematics, mechanics and computer science. Now you'll never miss a cool lecture or seminar!

It will be possible to choose the most appropriate lecture room, taking into account its capacity, the schedule of the entire faculty, the presence of (working) projector and the position of the sun.
